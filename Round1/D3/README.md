## Day 3

# What did I do?
So today I started using Flutter on my own just to strengthen my knowledge on the basics. As you can see in the code is not much but for my second day using Flutter I am quite impressed how
fast you can build a 'working' app with it. 

Worked with:
-> Images
-> Fonts
-> Icons
-> AppBar
-> FloatingActionButton
-> Button
-> Container
-> Rows and Columns

# How long did it take?
3 hours

# Problems I had
None because i am still at the very beginning
