## Day 2

### What did I do?
Changed my plan of learning Web development because I always wanted to build mobile apps. The Reason I chose going for WebDev was my previous knowledge of HTML CSS and Javascript I had left and the option to use React Native. But I found out
about Flutter which has in my opinion a nice looking syntax and its ability to create Webpages (if I want to in the future and it's still in Beta). So I decided to go this way and learn it. 
Today I startet an online Course (https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)

So because I've just started the course there is no Code today. Just got in the Theory of Flutter and the possibilities that comes with the language and finaly prepared everything.
Tomorrow is going to be my first time coding Flutter.

### How long did it take?
2 hour

### Problems I had
None because I have just Started

## Day 3

### What did I do?
So today I started using Flutter on my own just to strengthen my knowledge on the basics. As you can see in the code is not much but for my second day using Flutter I am quite impressed how
fast you can build a 'working' app with it. 

Worked with:
-> Images
-> Fonts
-> Icons
-> AppBar
-> FloatingActionButton
-> Button
-> Container
-> Rows and Columns

3 hours

None because i am still at the very beginning
